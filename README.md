# C Programming Lab

This repository contains a collection of C programs I wrote while practicing
C programming fundamentals and systems-level concepts.

The code is organized by topic (basics, control flow, math/series, arrays, strings,
pointers, bitwise operations, macros, functions, file I/O, formatted I/O, algorithms, matrices,
and simple record structures).

The goals was to:

- Strengthen C fundamentals for embedded/software development  
- Practice clean, readable C code with input validation and error handling  
- Explore low-level concepts: pointers, bitwise operations, IEEE representation, endianness  
- Implement small but complete utilities

C Compiler Used : GCC
